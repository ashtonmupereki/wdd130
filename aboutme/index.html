    <h2>Ashton Mupereki</h2>
    <p>I have a Pathway Connect Certificate and I am currently doing a certificate in Web and Computer Programming majoring in Software Development Bachelor`s degree. I have tons of passion in software and websites development as well as in anthology. More over i also have some interest in researching, gaming and travelling during my free time. I am a single man aged 20. Currently I am not working. I`m just focusing with my studies. As I pursue my education there is and will be a great change in my life through getting internationally recognized qualifications. BYU-I is a great deal for because it offers high quality education and also spiritual studies, so as it draws students near to the Lord.  </p>
    <p>Learning about careers in web design will `enable people to have creative minds thus having effective solutions to certain issues. Since web design is a growing industry, there are plenty of opportunities to work in the field of web design and that`s the major two reasons I decided to engage in it and I will use the information in my personal life through working and creating some websites. I am not a member of the Church Of Jesus Christ Of Latter Day Saints but I like a qoute from President Russel M.Nelson which says, "You can overcome the spiritually and emotionally exhausting plagues of the world, including arrogance, pride, anger, immorality, hatred, greed, jealous and fear". This qoute always strengtherns me during hard times. I also thrive on the scripture from John 15:12 which says, "my command is this: love each other as i have loved you". Love is a great thing that really matters to my life.</p>
    <p>The pleasure is for me to introduce myself to my classmates. Thank you!</p>
